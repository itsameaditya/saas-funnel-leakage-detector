Executive Summary

This project simulates a 20,000-user B2B SaaS funnel to identify revenue leakage and quantify growth opportunities.

Key Findings
	•	Activated users convert at 30.3% vs 0.7% for non-activated users (43x uplift).
	•	Paid Social users activate at 43%, significantly below Organic (68%).
	•	Closing this activation gap could generate ~$378K in additional ARR annually.
	•	Mobile payment failure rate is 13.7% vs 5.5% on web (2.5x higher).
	•	Reducing mobile checkout friction could add ~$89K ARR annually.

Strategic Recommendation
	1.	Prioritize activation improvements for Paid Social traffic.
	2.	Improve mobile checkout reliability.
	3.	Optimize onboarding for lower-performing channels.
